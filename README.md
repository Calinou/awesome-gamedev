# Awesome Gamedev #

A curated list of good stuff related to the development of games. This list
contains *only* [free software][1] for code, sellers who aren't evil for
physical resources, and [free cultural works][2] for assets.

I have also provided a list of resources which are *not* free, and the reasons
why, in the associated Wall of Shame file.
